= ReportService Test Specification\
\
== Introduction\
\
This document describes the test cases for the `ReportService` class. The `ReportService` class is responsible for handling CRUD operations related to reports in the system.\
\
== Test Cases\
\
=== Test Case 1: Create Report\
Purpose::\
  To verify that the `createReport` method of the `ReportService` class correctly creates a new report.\
\
Test Steps::\
1. Create a mock report object.\
2. Mock the repository's `save` method to return the mock report.\
3. Call the `createReport` method with the mock report.\
4. Verify that the returned report matches the mock report.\
5. Verify that the repository's `save` method is called exactly once.\
\
Expected Outcome::\
The `createReport` method should create a new report and return it. The report should be saved using the repository's `save` method.\
\
=== Test Case 2: Update Report\
Purpose::\
  To verify that the `updateReport` method of the `ReportService` class correctly updates an existing report.\
\
Test Steps::\
1. Create a mock existing report object.\
2. Mock the repository's `findById` method to return the mock existing report.\
3. Mock the repository's `save` method to return the updated report.\
4. Call the `updateReport` method with the mock existing report and an updated report object.\
5. Verify that the returned report matches the updated report.\
6. Verify that the repository's `findById` method is called exactly once.\
7. Verify that the repository's `save` method is called exactly once.\
\
Expected Outcome::\
The `updateReport` method should update the existing report with the provided data and return the updated report.\
\
=== Test Case 3: Delete Report\
Purpose::\
  To verify that the `deleteReport` method of the `ReportService` class correctly deletes an existing report.\
\
Test Steps::\
1. Mock the repository's `existsById` method to return true.\
2. Mock the repository's `deleteById` method.\
3. Call the `deleteReport` method with a report ID.\
4. Verify that the repository's `existsById` method is called exactly once.\
5. Verify that the repository's `deleteById` method is called exactly once.\
\
Expected Outcome::\
The `deleteReport` method should successfully delete the report with the provided ID and return true. If the report does not exist, it should return false.\
\
=== Test Case 4: Get All Reports\
Purpose::\
  To verify that the `getAllReports` method of the `ReportService` class correctly retrieves all reports from the repository.\
\
Test Steps::\
1. Mock the repository's `findAll` method to return a list of mock reports.\
2. Call the `getAllReports` method.\
3. Verify that the returned list of reports matches the mock reports.\
4. Verify that the repository's `findAll` method is called exactly once.\
\
Expected Outcome::\
The `getAllReports` method should retrieve a list of all reports from the repository and return it.\
\
== Conclusion\
\
The tests described in this document ensure that the `ReportService` class functions as expected, handling report creation, updating, deletion, and retrieval operations accurately.}
